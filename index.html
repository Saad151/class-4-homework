        <h1>Traffic jam: The ugly side of Dhaka's development</h1>
        <p id="p_1">There was a time when commuters suffered traffic congestion only on the main city streets, but now it starts right from one's doorstep. Traffic jam has turned daily trips into nightmares. According to a World Bank report, in the last 10 years, the average traffic speed in Dhaka has dropped from 21 kilometres per hour (kmph) to 7 kmph, and by 2035, the speed might drop to 4kmph, which is slower than the walking speed. Another study, commissioned by Brac Institute of Government and Development, says traffic congestion in Dhaka eats up around 5 million working hours every day and costs the country USD 11.4 billion every year. The financial loss is a calculation of the cost of time lost in traffic congestion and the money spent on operating vehicles for the extra hours.</p>
